        <p class="card-book-content-description">
            Introducing the only cookbook to put homemade bread and convenience in the same sentence—whether you're a beginner baker or an enthusiast. Learn seven core recipes and then manipulate them into different shapes and flavors with ease for tons of new breads. Fit bread into your schedule with flexible, customizable timetables. Maybe you're looking to get bread on the table tonight, or maybe spreading steps over a few days is better for you. Recipes follow both paths, with new, streamlined techniques, no specialty equipment, and even loaves with no yeast, kneading, or shaping. You won't believe the chewy, open crumb and ultracrisp crust you'll get from no-knead Dutch oven-baked loaves, the ease of quick breads that come together with a stir, and the dinner possibilities for flatbreads of all kinds.
